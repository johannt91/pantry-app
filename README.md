# Pantry App

## Description
Keeping track of pantry items isn't always easy. Although there are apps out there that already tackle this issue, they include too many features which makes the app feel cluttered. Tracking your pantry items should be simpler. This app aims to accomplish managing your pantry with a clean and simple interface.

## Features
The following are some of the basic features for the app:
 - Items categorized by food type
 - Items can be searched for availability
 - Unavailable items can either be marked as "out of stock" or saved to a shopping list
 - Track expiration date of items
 - Mark items as "low stock"

Ideas for future development:
 - Scan item barcodes to store information faster
 - Include a separate section for household supplies
